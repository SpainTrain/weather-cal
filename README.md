# Weather Calendar

Use for free at [https://calendars.raodix.com](https://calendars.raodix.com)

To run your own version, here are the high level steps:

1. Create an API key at [https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys](https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys)
1. Create a Firebase project at [https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)
1. `firebase init` in this directory (you will need emulators, auth, firestore, and hosting)

If there is interest in more specific directions to run your own, feel free to open a Github issue here.
